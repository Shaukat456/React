React.js Beginner Course — Syllabus

Course goal

Teach modern React fundamentals (components, state, props, hooks) with practical, runnable examples that work without bundlers. Each lesson builds on the previous one and includes:

- Learning objectives and a short checklist
- Key concepts with small code examples
- Real-world scenarios showing when to use (or avoid) the feature
- Good and bad practices
- Interview-style questions with concise model answers

Course sequence and outcomes

1. Lesson 01 — React basics & rendering model

   - Outcome: Understand JSX, createElement, the virtual DOM, and React's render pipeline.

2. Lesson 02 — Components & composition

   - Outcome: Design small, composable function components and structure an app.

3. Lesson 03 — Props & State (data flow)

   - Outcome: Distinguish props vs. state, lift state, and structure shared data.

4. Lesson 04 — Hooks (useState, useEffect) and side effects

   - Outcome: Use hooks safely (rules of hooks), handle effects and cleanup.

5. Lesson 05 — Forms & controlled components
6. Lesson 06 — Lists, keys, conditional rendering & performance
7. Lesson 07 — Routing, code-splitting, and lazy loading
8. Lesson 08 — Context, refs, memoization and performance tuning
9. Lesson 09 — State management strategies and testing fundamentals
10. Lesson 10 — Build, deploy and next steps (Vite, deployment options)

Next steps

If you'd like, I will expand Lessons 05–10 in the same detailed style (theory + runnable examples + interview Q&A). For now I will expand Lessons 01–04 with detailed content, scenarios, best/worst practices, and interview questions.

dynamics keys,
use state in detail,
use effect
conditional rendering
